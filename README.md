-----------Echelle: e-Commerce Inventory Backend----------

Overview

    Welcome to "Echelle" an e-Commerce inventory database management program. You can use this program to keep track of and update available inventory.

Designers

    In the column on the left of the program, you will see a list of all current designers. Clicking on a designer name in the left column will display all the items by this designer.

    You can add a new designer by filling out the form on the right of the screen titled "Add Designer." Designers are stored in their own database table and will be associated with their corresponding items.

    You can delete a designer by clicking the "edit" button at the top of the list of designers and then clicking the corresponding "x" button of the designer you'd like to delete.

Seasons

    To view items sorted by season, click one of the four seasons at the top of the page. You will then see a list of items which correspond to that season. Since you are now sorting items by season, this will include items from multiple designers, rather than one specific designer.

Items

    To reiterate, items can be sorted and displayed either by their designer or their season by using one of the two methods above.

    To add a new item, use the "Add Item" form on the right. Before filling out the form, click on the designer in the left column that the new item belongs to. This enables the item to be stored in the database with the correctly associated designer.

    Continue to fill out the rest of the form, click submit, and your item will be stored and displayed.

Editing Items

    Any item can be edited or deleted. To edit or delete, click on the item's "Edit" button. To edit, make the changes you want in the form that appears and click submit.

    To delete, click "Delete" and the item will be removed from the database.
